About Me
Hi, I'm Jack, a 15-year-old passionate about coding, gaming, and technology. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how things work behind the scenes—whether it’s how websites are built, how games function, or how automation makes life easier. That curiosity led me to dive deep into programming, game development, and website creation. Now, I’m turning my passion into something bigger: an online business where I can help others with coding, gaming-related tech, and website development.

My Skills & Experience
I specialize in a variety of coding-related services, including:

Website Development – I build clean, modern, and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
Game Development – Whether it's scripting for games or automation for in-game actions, I have experience working with game-related coding.
Automation & Bots – I create custom bots for Discord and other platforms to enhance user experience and automate tasks.
Tech & Gaming Solutions – Need help optimizing gaming setups, coding game-related features, or troubleshooting tech issues? I’m here to help.
Why Work With Me?
I’m not just someone who codes—I’m someone who understands the real-world applications of technology in gaming, business, and everyday life. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and making sure my clients get the best possible results. Whether you're looking for a professional website, a custom bot, or a gaming-related tech solution, I bring creativity and technical expertise to the table.

Beyond Coding
When I’m not writing code or working on tech projects, I’m deeply involved in the gaming community. I compete in Fortnite tournaments, experiment with AI-driven Rocket League bots, and explore new trends in the gaming and coding world. Gaming isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s part of what drives my passion for technology.
